Maintainers, no pressure, but it's {{ days }} days before the next scheduled release! Just a friendly reminder to make sure there are no loose ends. 

 _I was asked to post a reminder about issues labelled `{{ label }}`. If you'd like me to stop bumping, just comment with `@cesium-concierge stop`. If you want me to start again, just delete the comment._
